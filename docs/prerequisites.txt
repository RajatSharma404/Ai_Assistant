# Prerequisites and Setup Guide for YourDaddy v3.0 - Advanced AI Assistant

## Project Overview
YourDaddy v3.0 is an advanced AI assistant with the following capabilities:
- **Offline Wake Word Detection** ("Hey Daddy")
- **Offline Speech-to-Text** (No internet required for voice commands)
- **Computer Vision** (Can see and analyze your screen)
- **Memory System** (Remembers past conversations)
- **Windows Automation** (Full control of Windows applications)
- **Natural Language Processing** via Google Gemini AI

## System Requirements

### Operating System
- **Windows 10 or Windows 11** (Required)
- Administrative privileges may be needed for certain automation tasks

### Python Environment
- **Python 3.8 or higher** (Recommended: Python 3.9-3.11)
- **Virtual environment** (strongly recommended to avoid conflicts)

### Required Tools and Software
1. **Git** (for cloning and version control)
2. **Visual Studio Code** (recommended IDE)
3. **Windows PowerShell or Command Prompt**
4. **Microphone** (for voice commands)
5. **Speakers/Headphones** (for voice responses)

## Environment Setup

### 1. API Keys Required
Before running the application, you must obtain and set up the following API keys:

#### Google Gemini API Key (Required)
- Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
- Create a new API key for Gemini
- Set the environment variable:
  ```bash
  # Windows Command Prompt
  set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  
  # Windows PowerShell
  $env:GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
  
  # For permanent setup, add to System Environment Variables
  ```

#### Picovoice Access Key (Required for Wake Word)
- Visit [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/)
- Sign up for a free account
- Get your AccessKey from the dashboard
- Update the `PICOVOICE_ACCESS_KEY` variable in `yourdaddy_app.py` (line ~75)

### 2. Python Virtual Environment Setup
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows Command Prompt:
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# On Windows PowerShell:
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# On Git Bash:
source .venv/Scripts/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install all required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or install core packages individually:
pip install autogen-agentchat autogen-ext pywinauto google-generativeai openai
pip install pvporcupine vosk pillow pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition pyaudio
```

### 4. Download Required Model Files

#### Vosk Speech Recognition Model (Required for Offline STT)
```bash
# Download the small English model (about 50MB)
# Create model directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir model
cd model

# Download and extract Vosk model
# You can download from: https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models
# Extract to: model/vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15/
```

#### Wake Word File (Required)
- The project should include `hey-daddy_en_windows_v3_0_0.ppn`
- This file is used for offline wake word detection
- If missing, you can create custom wake words at [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/)

## Windows-Specific Prerequisites

### Windows Automation Dependencies
The project uses `pywinauto` for Windows GUI automation, which requires:

1. **Windows Accessibility APIs** (usually pre-installed)
2. **UI Automation support** (built into Windows 10/11)
3. **Administrative privileges** for some automation tasks

### Audio System Requirements
For voice features to work properly:
- **Working microphone** with proper drivers
- **Audio output device** (speakers/headphones)
- **Windows Audio service** running
- **Microphone permissions** granted to Python/Terminal

### Offline Processing Requirements
- **Sufficient disk space** (minimum 100MB for Vosk model)
- **Adequate RAM** (minimum 4GB recommended for smooth operation)
- **CPU with decent performance** (for real-time speech processing)

## Application Permissions

### Required Permissions
- **File system access** (for reading/writing notes and memory database)
- **Application launch permissions** (to open programs)
- **Registry read access** (for Windows settings)
- **Network access** (for web searches and Gemini API calls)
- **Microphone access** (for voice commands - CRITICAL)
- **Screen capture access** (for vision capabilities)

### Optional Permissions
- **Notification permissions** (for toast notifications)
- **System settings access** (for opening Windows Settings)
- **Audio device control** (for volume adjustment)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. GEMINI_API_KEY Not Set
**Error**: "GEMINI_API_KEY not set"
**Solution**: Set the environment variable and restart VS Code/terminal

### 2. Picovoice AccessKey Issues
**Error**: "Picovoice AccessKey not set" or wake word not working
**Solutions**:
- Sign up at [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/)
- Copy your AccessKey and update line ~75 in `yourdaddy_app.py`
- Ensure `.ppn` file exists in project directory

### 3. Vosk Model Missing
**Error**: "Model not found" or speech recognition fails
**Solutions**:
- Download Vosk model from [https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models)
- Extract to `model/vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15/` directory
- Ensure directory structure is correct

### 4. PyWinAuto Access Issues
**Error**: Application automation fails
**Solutions**:
- Run as administrator
- Ensure target applications are not running as admin (if your script isn't)
- Check Windows UAC settings

### 5. Audio/Microphone Issues
**Error**: "Microphone not working" or "No audio input"
**Solutions**:
- Check microphone permissions in Windows Privacy settings
- Test microphone in Windows Sound settings
- Ensure PyAudio is properly installed: `pip install pyaudio`
- Try running as administrator

### 6. Import Errors
**Error**: Module not found errors
**Solutions**:
- Ensure virtual environment is activated
- Reinstall requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check Python version compatibility (3.8+)

## Development Environment

### Recommended VS Code Extensions
- Python
- Python Debugger
- Pylance
- Python Indent
- autoDocstring

### Code Formatting (Optional)
```bash
pip install black flake8 mypy
```

## Security Considerations

### API Key Security
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables or secure key management
- Regularly rotate API keys

### Windows Security
- Be cautious with automation scripts that have broad system access
- Test in a controlled environment first
- Consider running in a limited user account for testing

## Performance Notes

### System Resources
- **CPU Usage**: Higher during voice processing and AI inference
- **Memory Usage**: ~200-500MB depending on loaded models
- **Disk Space**: Minimum 100MB for Vosk model
- **Network**: Intermittent usage for Gemini API calls and web searches

### Optimization Tips
- Use virtual environments to avoid package conflicts
- Keep Windows and audio drivers updated for best automation compatibility
- Monitor API usage to avoid Gemini rate limits
- Close unnecessary applications for better speech recognition performance
- Use SSD for faster model loading if available
